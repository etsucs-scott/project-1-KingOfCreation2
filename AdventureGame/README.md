This is my maze adventure game inspired by league of legends!

Author: Jake Littlejohn

Description: You will navigate through a randomly made maze.
You will fight monsters, collect weapons, and reach the enemy nexus to win!

Controls: You can use WSAD or the arrow keys to move.

Battles: When walking onto a space with a monster you will enter a battle with
a randomly generated monster that I have created. They range from very strong to very weak.
You will then take turns attacking each other until one of you dies.

Weapons: When walking onto a space with a weapon you will pick it up and will add to your attack.
If you pick up another weapon, the higher attack value will be used. But it wont get rid of the old weapon.

Good luck and hopefully you have as much fun as I did. I lost several times in a row -_-
